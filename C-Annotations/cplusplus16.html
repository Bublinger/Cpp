    As we have seen in the previous chapter, <strong>C++</strong> provides the tools to derive
classes from one base type, to use base class pointers to 
address derived objects, and subsequently to process derived objects in a
generic class.
</p><p>Concerning the allowed operations on all objects in such a generic class we
have seen that the base class must define the actions to be performed on all
derived objects. In the example of the <code>Vehicle</code> this was the functionality
to store and retrieve the weight of a vehicle.
</p><p>When using a base class pointer to address an object of a derived class, the
pointer type (i.e., the base class type) normally determines which function
will actually be called. This means that the code example from section
<a href="cplusplus15.html#VStorage">15.7</a> using the storage class <code>VStorage</code>, will incorrectly
compute the combined weight when a <code>Truck</code> object (see section <a href="cplusplus15.html#Truck">15.4</a>)
is in the storage: only one weight field of the engine part of the truck is
taken into consideration. The reason for this is obvious: a <code>Vehicle *vp</code>
calls the function <code>Vehicle::getweight()</code> and not <code>Truck::getweight()</code>,
even when that pointer actually points to a <code>Truck</code>.
</p><p>However, a remedy is available. In <strong>C++</strong> it is possible for a
<code>Vehicle *vp</code> to call a function <code>Truck::getweight()</code> when the pointer
actually points to a <code>Truck</code>. 
</p><p>The terminology for this feature is <em>polymorphism</em>: 
it is as though the pointer <code>vp</code> assumes the type of the object it points
to, rather than keeping it own (base class) type.
So, <code>vp</code> might behave
like a <code>Truck *</code> when pointing to a <code>Truck</code>, or like an <code>Auto *</code> when
pointing to an <code>Auto</code> etc.. (In one of the StarTrek movies, Cap.
Kirk was in trouble, as usual. He met an extremely beautiful lady who however
thereupon changed into a hideous troll. Kirk was quite surprised, but the lady
told him:  ``Didn't you know I am a polymorph?'')
</p><p>A second term for this characteristic is <em>late binding</em>. 
This name refers to the
fact that the decision <em>which</em> function to call (a base class function or
a function of a derived class) cannot be made <em>compile-time</em>, 
but is postponed
until the program is actually executed: the right function is selected 
<em>run-time</em>.
</p><p>

<h2>16.1: Virtual functions</h2>
    <a name="virtual/function"></a>
    The default behavior of the activation of a member function via a pointer is
that the <em>type</em> of the pointer determines the function. E.g., a
<code>Vehicle*</code> will activate <code>Vehicle</code>'s member functions, even when
pointing to an object of a derived class. This is referred to as <em>early</em> or
<em>static</em> binding, since the type of function is known compile-time. The
<em>late</em> or <em>dynamic</em> binding is achieved in <strong>C++</strong> with 
<em>virtual functions</em>.
</p><p>A function becomes virtual when its declaration starts with the keyword
<code>virtual</code>. Once a function is declared <code>virtual</code> in a base class, its
definition remains <code>virtual</code> in all derived classes; even when the keyword
<code>virtual</code> is not repeated in the definition of the derived classes.
</p><p>As far as the vehicle classification system is concerned (see section 
<a href="cplusplus15.html#VehicleSystem">15.1</a> ff.) the two member functions <code>getweight()</code> and
<code>setweight()</code> might be declared as <code>virtual</code>. The class definitions
below illustrate the classes <code>Vehicle</code> (which is the overall base class of
the classification system) and <code>Truck</code>, which has <code>Vehicle</code> as an
indirect base class. The functions <code>getweight()</code> of the two classes are
also shown:
</p><p><pre>

    class Vehicle
    {
        public:
            Vehicle();      // constructors
            Vehicle(int wt);

                            // interface.. now virtuals!
            virtual int getweight() const;
            virtual void setweight(int wt);
            
        private:
            int             // data
                weight;
    }

    // Vehicle's own getweight() function:
    int Vehicle::getweight() const
    {
        return (weight);
    }

    class Land: public Vehicle
    {
        ...
    }

    class Auto: public Land
    {
        ...
    }

    class Truck: public Auto
    {
        public:
            Truck();        // constructors
            Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                  int trailer_wt);

                            // interface: to set two weight fields
            void setweight(int engine_wt, int trailer_wt);
                            // and to return combined weight
            int getweight() const;

        private:
            int             // data
                trailer_weight;
    };

    // Truck's own getweight() function
    int Truck::getweight() const
    {
        return (Auto::getweight() + trailer_wt);
    }

</pre>

</p><p>Note that the keyword <code>virtual</code> appears only in the definition of the base
class <code>Vehicle</code>; it need not be repeated in the derived classes (though a
repetition would be no error).
</p><p>The effect of the late binding is illustrated in the next fragment:
</p><p><pre>

    Vehicle
        v(1200);            // vehicle with weight 1200
    Truck
        t(6000, 115,        // truck with cabin weight 6000, speed 115,
          "Scania",         // make Scania, trailer weight 15000
          15000);

    Vehicle
        *vp;                // generic vehicle pointer

    int main()
    {
        // see below (1)
        vp = &amp;v;
        printf("%d\n", vp-&gt;getweight());

        // see below (2)
        vp = &amp;t;
        printf("%d\n", vp-&gt;getweight());

        // see below (3)
        printf("%d\n", vp-&gt;getspeed());

        return (0);
    }

</pre>

</p><p>Since the function <code>getweight()</code> is defined as <code>virtual</code>, late binding is
used here: in the statements above, just below the <code>(1)</code> mark, <code>Vehicle</code>'s
function <code>getweight()</code> is called. In contrast, the statements below <code>(2)</code>
use <code>Truck</code>'s function <code>getweight()</code>.
</p><p>Statement <code>(3)</code> however will produces a syntax error. A function
<code>getspeed()</code> is no member of <code>Vehicle</code>, and hence also not callable via
a <code>Vehicle*</code>.
</p><p>The rule is that when using a pointer to a class, 
<em>only the functions which are members of that class can be called</em>.
These functions can be <code>virtual</code>,
but this only affects the type of binding (early vs. late).

</p><p><a name="l268"></a>
<h3>16.1.1: Polymorphism in program development</h3>
        <a name="virtual/polymorphism"></a>
    When functions are defined as <code>virtual</code> in a base class (and hence in all
derived classes), and when these functions are called using a pointer to the
base class, the pointer as it were can assume more forms: it is polymorph. In
this section we illustrate the effect of polymorphism on the manner in which
programs in <strong>C++</strong> can be developed.
</p><p>A vehicle classification system in <strong>C</strong> might be implemented with
<code>Vehicle</code> being a union of <code>struct</code>s, and having an enumeration field to
determine which actual type of vehicle is represented. A function
<code>getweight()</code> would typically first determine what type of vehicle is
represented, and then inspect the relevant fields:
</p><p><pre>

    enum Vtype                  // type of the vehicle 
    {
        is_vehicle,
        is_land,
        is_auto,
        is_truck,
    }
    struct Vehicle              // generic vehicle type 
    {
        int weight;
    }
    struct Land                 // land vehicle: adds speed 
    {
        Vehicle v;
        int speed;
    }
    struct Auto                 // auto: Land vehicle + name 
    {
        Land l;
        char *name;
    }
    struct Truck                // truck: Auto + trailer 
    {
        Auto a;
        int trailer_wt;
    }
    union AnyVehicle            // all sorts of vehicles in 1 union 
    { 
        Vehicle v;
        Land l;
        Auto a;
        Truck t;
    }
    struct Object               // the data for all vehicles 
    { 
        Vtype type;
        AnyVehicle thing;
    }

    int getweight(Object *o)   // how to get weight of a vehicle 
    { 
        switch (o-&gt;type)
        {
            case is_vehicle:
                return (o-&gt;thing.v.weight);
            case is_land:
                return (o-&gt;thing.l.v.weight);
            case is_auto:
                return (o-&gt;thing.a.l.v.weight);
            case is_truck:
                return (o-&gt;thing.t.a.l.v.weight +
                        o-&gt;thing.t.trailer_wt);
        }
    }
 
</pre>

    A disadvantage of this approach is that the implementation cannot be
easily changed. E.g., if we wanted to define a type <code>Airplane</code>, which would,
e.g., add the functionality to store the number of passengers, then we'd have
to re-edit and re-compile the above code.
</p><p>In contrast, <strong>C++</strong> offers the possiblity of polymorphism. The advantage
is that `old' code remains usable. The implementation of an extra class
<code>Airplane</code> would in <strong>C++</strong> mean one extra class, possibly with its own
(virtual) functions <code>getweight()</code> and <code>setweight()</code>. A function like:
 <pre>

    void printweight(Vehicle const *any)
    {
        printf("Weight: %d\n", any-&gt;getweight());
    }
 
</pre>

 would still work; the function wouldn't even need to be recompiled, since
late binding is in effect.

<h3>16.1.2: How polymorphism is implemented</h3>
        <a name="virtual/implementation"></a>
    This section briefly describes how polymorphism is implemented in <strong>C++</strong>.
Understanding the implementation is not necessary for the usage of this
feature of <strong>C++</strong>, though it does explain why there is a cost of
polymorphism in terms of memory usage.
</p><p>The fundamental idea of polymorphism is that the <strong>C++</strong> compiler does not
know which function to call at compile-time; the appropriate function 
will be selected run-time. That means that the address of 
the function must be stored
somewhere, to be looked up prior to the actual call. This `somewhere' place
must be accessible from the object in question. E.g., when a <code>Vehicle *vp</code>
points to a <code>Truck</code> object, then <code>vp-&gt;getweight()</code> calls a member
function of <code>Truck</code>; the address of this function is determined from the
actual object which <code>vp</code> points to.
</p><p>A common implementation is the following. An object containing
virtual functions holds as its first data member a hidden field, pointing to
an array of pointers holding the addresses of the virtual functions. It
must be noted that this implementation is compiler-dependent, and is by no
means dictated by the <strong>C++</strong> ANSI definition.
</p><p>The table of addresses of virtual functions is shared by all objects of
the class. It even may be the case that two classes share the same table. The
overhead in terms of memory consumption is therefore:
</p><p><ul>
</p><p><li > One extra pointer field per object, which points to:
</p><p><li > One table of pointers per (derived) class to address the virtual
    functions.
</p><p></ul>
</p><p>Consequently, a statement like <code>vp-&gt;getweight()</code> first inspects the hidden 
data
member of the object pointed to by <code>vp</code>. In the case of the vehicle
classification system, this data member points to a table of two addresses:
one pointer for the function <code>getweight()</code> and one pointer for the function
<code>setweight()</code>. The actual function which is called is determined from this
table.
</p><p>The internal organization of the objects having virtual functions is further
illustrated in figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#ImplementationFigure">13</a>.
</p><p><a name="ImplementationFigure"></a></p><p><center><img src="virtual/implementation.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 13 is shown here."><br> 
figure 13: Internal organization objects when virtual functions are defined. 
</center></p><p>
    
</p><p>As can be seen from figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#ImplementationFigure">13</a>, all objects which
use virtual functions must have one (hidden) data member to address a table of
function pointers. The objects of the classes <code>Vehicle</code> and <code>Auto</code> both
address the same table. The class <code>Truck</code>, however, introduces its own
version of <code>getweight()</code>: therefore, this class needs its own table of
function pointers.

</p><p><a name="l270"></a>
<h2>16.2: Pure virtual functions</h2>
    <a name="virtual/pure"></a>
    Until now the base class <code>Vehicle</code> contained its own, concrete,
implementations of the virtual functions <code>getweight()</code> and
<code>setweight()</code>. In <strong>C++</strong> it is however also possible only to <em>mention</em>
virtual functions in a base class, and not define them. The functions are
concretely implemented in a derived class. This approach defines a
<em>protocol</em>, which has to be followed in the derived classes.
</p><p>The special feature of only <em>declaring</em> functions in a base class, and not
<em>defining</em> them, is that derived classes must take care of the actual
definition: the <strong>C++</strong> compiler will not allow the definition of an object
of a class which doesn't concretely define the function in question. The base
class thus enforces a protocol by declaring a function by its name, return
value and arguments; but the derived classes must take care of the actual
implementation. The base class itself is therefore only a <em>model</em>, to be
used for the derivation of other classes. Such base classes are also called
<em> abstract</em> classes.
</p><p>The functions which are only declared but not defined in the base class are
called <em>pure virtual functions</em>. A function is made pure virtual by
preceding its declaration with the keyword <code>virtual</code> and by postfixing it
with <code>= 0</code>. An example of a pure virtual function occurs in the following
listing, where the definition of a class <code>Sortable</code> requires that all
subsequent classes have a function <code>compare()</code>:
</p><p><pre>

    class Sortable
    {
        public:
            virtual int compare(Sortable const &amp;other) const = 0;
    };

</pre>

</p><p>The function <code>compare()</code> must return an <code>int</code> and receives a reference
to a second <code>Sortable</code> object. Possibly its action would be to compare the
current object with the <code>other</code> one. The function is not allowed to alter 
the other
object, as <code>other</code> is declared <code>const</code>. Furthermore, the function is not
allowed to alter the current object, as the function itself is declared
<code>const</code>.
</p><p>The above base class can be used as a model for derived classes. As an example
consider the following class <code>Person</code> (a prototype of which was introduced
in chapter <a href="cplusplus06.html#Person">6.1</a>), capable of comparing two <code>Person</code>
objects by the alphabetical order of their names and addresses:
</p><p><pre>

    class Person: public Sortable
    {
        public:
            // constructors, destructor, and stuff
            Person();
            Person(char const *nm, char const *add, char const *ph);
            Person(Person const &amp;other);
            Person const &amp;operator=(Person const &amp;other);
            ~Person();
            
            // interface
            char const *getname() const;
            char const *getaddress() const;
            char const *getphone() const;
            void setname(char const *nm);
            void setaddress(char const *add);
            void setphone(char const *ph);

            // requirements enforced by Sortable
            int compare(Sortable const &amp;other) const;

        private:
            // data members
            char *name, *address, *phone;
    };

    int Person::compare(Sortable const &amp;o)
    {
        Person 
            const &amp;other = (Person const &amp;)o;
        register int
            cmp;

        return
        (
            // first try: if names unequal, we're done
            (cmp = strcmp(name, other.name)) ?
                cmp
            :
                // second try: compare by addresses
                strcmp(address, other.address)
        );
    }

</pre>
    
</p><p>Note in the implementation of <code>Person::compare()</code> that the argument of the
function is not a reference to a <code>Person</code> but a reference to a
<code>Sortable</code>. Remember that <strong>C++</strong> allows function overloading: a function
<code>compare(Person const &amp;other)</code> would be an entirely different function
from the one required by the protocol of <code>Sortable</code>. In the implementation
of the function we therefore cast the <code>Sortable&amp;</code> argument to a
<code>Person&amp;</code> argument.
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="l271"></a>
<h2>16.3: Comparing only Persons</h2>
        <a name="virtual/comparing"></a>
    Sometimes it may be useful to know in the concrete implementation of a pure
virtual function what the <code>other</code> object is. E.g., the function
<code>Person::compare()</code> should make the comparison <code>only</code> if the
<code>other</code> object is a <code>Person</code> too: imagine what the expression
</p><p><center><code>strcmp(name, other.name)</code> </center>
</p><p>would do when the <code>other</code> object were in fact not a <code>Person</code> and
hence did not have a <code>char *name</code> datamember.
</p><p>We therefore present here an improved version of the protocol of the class
<code>Sortable</code>. This class is expanded to require that each derived class
implements a function <code>int getsignature()</code>:
</p><p><pre>

    class Sortable
    {
        ...
        virtual int getsignature() const = 0;
        ...
    };

</pre>
    
</p><p>The concrete function <code>Person::compare()</code> can now compare names and
addresses only if the signatures of the current and other object match:
</p><p><pre>

    int Person::compare(Sortable const &amp;o)
    {
        register int
            cmp;
            
        // first, check signatures
        if ((cmp = getsignature() - o.getsignature()))
            return (cmp);

        Person 
            const &amp;other = (Person const &amp;)o;

        return
        (
            // next try: if names unequal, we're done
            (cmp = strcmp(name, other.name)) ?
                cmp
            :
                // last try: compare by addresses
                strcmp(address, other.address)
        );
    }

</pre>
    
</p><p>The crux of the matter is of course the function <code>getsignature()</code>. This
function should return a unique <code>int</code> value for its particular class.
An elegant implementation is the following:
</p><p><pre>

    class Person: public Sortable
    {
        ...
        // getsignature() now required too
        int getsignature() const;
    }

    int Person::getsignature() const
    {
        static int              // Person's own tag, I'm quite sure
            tag;                // that no other class can access it

        return ((int) &amp;tag);    // Hence, &amp;tag is unique for Person
    }

</pre>

</p><p>For the reader who's puzzled by our `elegant solution': the <code>static int tag</code>
defined in the <code>Person::getsignature()</code> function is just one variable, no 
matter how many <code>Person</code> objects exist. Furthermore, it's created 
compile-time as a global variable, since it's static. Hence, there's only one 
variable <code>tag</code> for the <code>Person</code> class. Its <em>address</em>, therefore, is 
uniquely connected to the <code>Person</code> class. This <code>address</code> is cast to an 
<code>int</code> which thus becomes the (unique) signature of <code>Person</code> objects.

</p><p><a name="l272"></a>
<h2>16.4: Virtual destructors</h2>
    <a name="virtual/destructor"></a>
    When the operator <code>delete</code> releases memory which is occupied by a
dynamically allocated object, a corresponding destructor is called to ensure
that internally used memory of the object can also be released. Now consider
the following code fragment, in which the two classes from the previous
sections are used:
</p><p><pre>

    Sortable
        *sp;
    Person
        *pp = new Person("Frank", "frank@icce.rug.nl", "363 3688");

    sp = pp;            // sp now points to a Person
    ...
    delete sp;          // object destroyed

</pre>

</p><p>In this example an object of a derived class (<code>Person</code>) is destroyed using a
base class pointer (<code>Sortable *</code>). For a `standard' class definition this
will mean that the destructor of <code>Sortable</code> is called, instead of the
destructor of <code>Person</code>.
</p><p><strong>C++</strong> however allows a destructor to be virtual. By preceding the
declaration of a destructor with the keyword <code>virtual</code> we can ensure that
the right destructor is activated even when called via a base class
pointer. The definition of the class <code>Sortable</code> would therefore become:
</p><p><pre>

    class Sortable
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Sortable();
            virtual int compare(Sortable const &amp;other) const = 0;
            ...
    };

</pre>
    
</p><p>Should the virtual destructor of the base class be a <em>pure</em> virtual
function or not? In general, the answer to this question would be no: for a
class such as <code>Sortable</code> the definition should not <em>force</em> derived
classes to define a destructor. In contrast, <code>compare()</code> is a pure virtual
function: in this case the base class defines a protocol which must be adhered
to.
</p><p>By defining the destructor of the base class as <code>virtual</code>, but not as
purely so, the base class offers the possibility of redefinition of the
destructor in any derived classes. The base class doesn't enforce the choice.
</p><p>The conclusion is therefore that the base class must define a destructor
function, which is used in the case that derived classes do <em>not</em> define
their own destructors. Such a destructor could be an empty function:
</p><p><pre>

    Sortable::~Sortable()
    {
    }

</pre>

<h2>16.5: Virtual functions in multiple inheritance</h2>
    <a name="virtual/multiple"></a>
    As was previously mentioned in chapter <a href="cplusplus15.html#Inheritance">15</a> it is possible
to derive a class from several base classes at once. Such a derived class
inherits the properties of all its base classes. Of course, the base classes
themselves may be derived from classes yet higher in the hierarchy.
</p><p>A slight difficulty in multiple inheritance may arise when more than one
`path' leads from the derived class to the base class. This is illustrated in
the code fragment below: a class <code>Derived</code> is doubly derived from a class
<code>Base</code>:
</p><p><pre>

    class Base
    {
        public:
            void setfield(int val)
                { field = val; }
            int getfield() const
                { return (field); }
        private:
            int field;
    };

    class Derived: public Base, public Base
    {
    };

</pre>
    
</p><p>Due to the double derivation, the functionality of <code>Base</code> now occurs twice
in <code>Derived</code>. This leads to ambiguity: when the function <code>setfield()</code> is
called for a <code>Derived</code> object, <em>which</em> function should that be, since
there are two? In such a duplicate derivation, many C++ compilers will fail to 
generate code and (correctly) identify the error.
</p><p>The above code clearly duplicates its base class in the derivation. Such a
duplication can be easily avoided here. But duplication of a base class can
also occur via nested inheritance, where an object is derived from, say, an
<code>Auto</code> and from an <code>Air</code> (see the vehicle classification system, chapter
<a href="cplusplus15.html#VehicleSystem">15.1</a>). Such a class would be needed to represent, e.g., a
flying car (such as the one in James Bond vs. the Man with the Golden
Gun...). An <code>AirAuto</code> would ultimately contain two <code>Vehicles</code>,
and hence two <code>weight</code> fields, two <code>setweight()</code> functions and two
<code>getweight()</code> functions. 

</p><p><a name="l274"></a>
<h3>16.5.1: Ambiguity in multiple inheritance</h3>
        <a name="virtual/ambiguity"></a>
    Let's investigate closer why an <code>AirAuto</code> introduces ambiguity, when
derived from <code>Auto</code> and <code>Air</code>.
</p><p><ul>
    <li > An <code>AirAuto</code> is an <code>Auto</code>, hence a <code>Land</code>, and hence a
        <code>Vehicle</code>.
    <li > However, an <code>AirAuto</code> is also an <code>Air</code>, and hence a
        <code>Vehicle</code>.
</ul>
</p><p>The duplication of <code>Vehicle</code> data is further illustrated in 
figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#ambiguity">14</a>.
</p><p><a name="ambiguity"></a></p><p><center><img src="virtual/ambiguity.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 14 is shown here."><br> 
figure 14: Duplication of a base class in multiple derivation. 
</center></p><p>
    
</p><p>The internal organization of an <code>AirAuto</code> is shown in 
figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#InternalOrganization">15</a>
</p><p><a name="InternalOrganization"></a></p><p><center><img src="virtual/internal.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 15 is shown here."><br> 
figure 15: Internal organization of an <code>AirAuto</code> object. 
</center></p><p>
    
</p><p>The <strong>C++</strong> compiler will detect the ambiguity in an <code>AirAuto</code> object, and
will therefore fail to produce code for a statement like:
</p><p><pre>

    AirAuto
        cool;

    printf("%d\n", cool.getweight());

</pre>

</p><p>The question of which member function <code>getweight()</code> should be called, cannot
be resolved by the compiler. The programmer has two possibilities to resolve
the ambiguity explicitly:
</p><p><ul>
    <li > First, the function call where the ambiguity occurs can be
        modified. This is done with the scope resolution operator:
<pre>

        // let's hope that the weight is kept in the Auto
        // part of the object..
        printf("%d\n", cool.Auto::getweight());

</pre>

</p><p>Note the place of the scope operator and the class name: before the name
        of the member function itself.
    <li > Second, a dedicated function <code>getweight()</code> could be created for
        the class <code>AirAuto</code>:
<pre>
    
        int AirAuto::getweight() const
        {
            return(Auto::getweight());
        }

</pre>
    
</ul>
</p><p>The second possibility from the two above is preferable, since it relieves the
programmer who uses the class <code>AirAuto</code> of special precautions.
</p><p>However, besides these explicit solutions, there is a more elegant one. This
will be discussed in the next section.

</p><p><a name="l275"></a>
<h3>16.5.2: Virtual base classes</h3>
        <a name="virtual/base"></a>
    As is illustrated in figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#InternalOrganization">15</a>, more than
one object of the type <code>Vehicle</code> is present in one <code>AirAuto</code>. The
result is not only an ambiguity in the functions which access the <code>weight</code>
data, but also the presence of two <code>weight</code> fields. This is somewhat
redundant, since we can assume that an <code>AirAuto</code> has just one weight.
</p><p>We can achieve that only one <em>Vehicle</em> will be contained in an <code>AirAuto</code>.
This is done by ensuring that the base class which is multiply present in a
derived class, is defined as a <em>virtual base class</em>. The behavior of
virtual base classes is the following: when a base class <code>B</code> is a virtual
base class of a derived class <code>D</code>, then <code>B</code> may be present in <code>D</code> but
this is not necessarily so. The compiler will leave out the inclusion of the
members of <code>B</code> when these are already present in <code>D</code>.
</p><p>For the class <code>AirAuto</code> this means that the derivation of <code>Land</code> and
<code>Air</code> is changed:
</p><p><pre>

    class Land: virtual public Vehicle
    {
        ...
    };

    class Air: virtual public Vehicle
    {
        ...
    };

</pre>

</p><p>The virtual derivation ensures that via the <code>Land</code> route, a <code>Vehicle</code> is
only added to a class when not yet present. The same holds true for the
<code>Air</code> route. This means that we can no longer say by which route a
<code>Vehicle</code> becomes a part of an <code>AirAuto</code>; we only can say that there is
one <code>Vehicle</code> object embedded.
</p><p>The internal organization of an <code>AirAuto</code> after virtual derivation is
shown in figure <a href="cplusplus16.html#VirtualBaseClass">16</a>.
</p><p><a name="VirtualBaseClass"></a></p><p><center><img src="virtual/virtbase.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 16 is shown here."><br> 
figure 16: Internal organization of an <code>AirAuto</code> object when the base
            classes are virtual. 
</center></p><p>
    
</p><p>With respect to virtual derivation we note:
</p><p><ul>
    <li > Virtual derivation is, in contrast to virtual functions, a pure
        compile-time issue: whether a derivation is virtual or not defines 
        how the compiler builds a class definition from other classes.
    <li > In the above example it would suffice to define either <code>Land</code> or
        <code>Air</code> with virtual derivation. That also would have the effect that 
        one
        definition of a <code>Vehicle</code> in an <code>AirAuto</code> would be dropped. 
        Defining
        both <code>Land</code> and <code>Air</code> as virtually derived is however by no means
        erroneous.
    <li > The fact that the <code>Vehicle</code> in an <code>AirAuto</code> is no longer
        `embedded' in <code>Auto</code> or <code>Air</code> has a consequence for the chain of
        construction. The constructor of an <code>AirAuto</code> will directly call the
        constructor of a <code>Vehicle</code>; this constructor will not be called from
        the constructors of <code>Auto</code> or <code>Air</code>.
</ul>
</p><p>Summarizing, virtual derivation has the consequence that ambiguity in the
calling of member functions of a base class is avoided. Furthermore,
duplication of data members is avoided.
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="l276"></a>
<h3>16.5.3: When virtual derivation is not appropriate</h3>
        <a name="virtual/notvirtual"></a>
    In contrast to the previous definition of a class such as <code>AirAuto</code>,
situations may arise where the double presence of the members of a base class
is appropriate. To illustrate this, consider the definition of a <code>Truck</code>
from section <a href="cplusplus15.html#Truck">15.4</a>:
</p><p><pre>

    class Truck: public Auto
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Truck();
            Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                   int trailer_wt);

            // interface: to set two weight fields
            void setweight(int engine_wt, int trailer_wt);
            // and to return combined weight
            int getweight() const;

        private:
            // data
            int trailer_weight;
    };

    // example of constructor
    Truck::Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                  int trailer_wt)
    : 
        Auto(engine_wt, sp, nm)
    {
        trailer_weight = trailer_wt;
    }

    // example of interface function
    int Truck::getweight() const
    {
        return
        (                           // sum of:    
            Auto::getweight() +     //   engine part plus    
            trailer_wt              //   the trailer    
        );    
    }

</pre>
    
</p><p>This definition shows how a <code>Truck</code> object is constructed to hold two
weight fields: one via its derivation from <code>Auto</code> and one via its own
<code>int trailer_weight</code> data member. Such a definition is of course valid, but
could be rewritten. We could let a <code>Truck</code> be derived from an <code>Auto</code>
<em>and</em> from a <code>Vehicle</code>, thereby explicitly requesting the double
presence of a <code>Vehicle</code>; one for the weight of the engine and cabin, and
one for the weight of the trailer.
</p><p>A small item of interest here is that a derivation like
</p><p><pre>

    class Truck: public Auto, public Vehicle

</pre>

</p><p>is not accepted by the <strong>C++</strong> compiler: a <code>Vehicle</code> is already part of an
<code>Auto</code>, and is therefore not needed. An intermediate class resolves the
problem: we derive a class <code>TrailerVeh</code> from <code>Vehicle</code>, and <code>Truck</code>
from <code>Auto</code> and from <code>TrailerVeh</code>.  All ambiguities concerning the
member functions are then be resolved in the class <code>Truck</code>:
</p><p><pre>

    class TrailerVeh: public Vehicle
    {
        public:
            TrailerVeh(int wt);
    };

    TrailerVeh::TrailerVeh(int wt)
    : 
        Vehicle(wt)
    {
    }
    
    class Truck: public Auto, public TrailerVeh
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Truck();
            Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                   int trailer_wt);

            // interface: to set two weight fields
            void setweight(int engine_wt, int trailer_wt);
            // and to return combined weight
            int getweight() const;
    };

    // example of constructor
    Truck::Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                  int trailer_wt)
    : 
        Auto(engine_wt, sp, nm), 
        TrailerVeh(trailer_wt)
    {
    }

    // example of interface function
    int Truck::getweight() const
    {
        return
            (                               // sum of:
                Auto::getweight() +        //   engine part plus
                TrailerVeh::getweight()    //   the trailer
            );
    }

<h2>16.6: Run-Time Type identification</h2>
    <a name="virtual/rtti"></a>
    <strong>C++</strong> offers two ways to retrieve the type of objects and expressions while
the program is run. The possibilities of <strong>C++</strong>'s <em>run-time type
identification</em> are somewhat limited compared to languages like
<strong>JAVA</strong>. Normally, <strong>C++</strong> uses static type checking and type
identification. Static type checking and determination is safer and more
efficient than run-time type identification, and should therefore be used
wherever possible. Nonetheles, <strong>C++</strong> offers run-time type identification by
providing the <em>dynamic cast</em> and <code>typeid</code> operators.
    <ul>
        <li > The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator can be used to convert a pointer or
reference to a base class to a pointer or reference to a derived class.
        <li > The <code>typeid</code> operator returns the actual type of an expression.
    </ul>
    For all practical purposes, these operators work on class type objects,
where the classes contain one or more virtual functions. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
    <a name="DYNAMICCAST"></a><a name="l278"></a>
<h3>16.6.1: The dynamic_cast operator</h3>
        <a name="virtual/dynamiccast"></a>
    The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator is used to convert a (base) class pointer or
reference to a (base) class object to, respectively, a derived class pointer
or derived class reference.
</p><p>The dynamic cast is performed run-time. A prerequisiste for the proper
functioning of the dynamic cast operator is the existence of at least one
virtual function in the base class. 
</p><p>In the following example a pointer to the class <code>Derived</code> is obtained from
the <code>Base</code> class pointer <code>bp</code>:
</p><p><pre>

    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
    };
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        public:
            char const *toString()
            {
                return ("Derived object");
            }
    };
    int main()
    {
        Base
            *bp;
        Derived
            *dp,
            d;

        bp = &amp;d;

        if ((dp = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived *&gt;(bp)))
            cout &lt;&lt; dp-&gt;toString() &lt;&lt; endl;
        else
            cout &lt;&lt; "dynamic cast conversion failed\n";

        return (0);
    }
        
</pre>

    Note the test: in the <code>if</code> condition the success of the dynamic cast is
checked. This must be done <em>run-time</em>, as the compiler can't do this
itself. If a base class pointer is provided the dynamic cast operator returns
0 on failure, and a pointer to the requested derived class on
success. Consequently, if there are multiple derived classes, a series of
checks could be performed to find the actual derived class to which the
pointer points:
        <pre>

    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
    };
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        public:
            char const *toString()
            {
                return ("Derived object");
            }
    };
    class SecondDerived: public Base
    {
        public:
            char const *hello()
            {
                return ("hello from a SecondDerived object");
            }
    };
    int main()
    {
        Base
            *bp;
        Derived
            *dp,
            d;
        SecondDerived
            *sdp;

        bp = &amp;d;

        if ((dp = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived *&gt;(bp)))
            cout &lt;&lt; dp-&gt;toString() &lt;&lt; endl;
        else if ((sdp = dynamic_cast&lt;SecondDerived *&gt;(bp)))
            cout &lt;&lt; dp-&gt;hello() &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
        
</pre>

</p><p>Alternatively, a reference to a base class object may be available. In
this case the <code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;()</code> operator will throw an exception if it
fails. For example, assuming the availability of the abovementioned classes
<code>Base, Derived</code>, and <code>SecondDerived</code>:
        <pre>

    void process(Base &amp;b)
    {
        try
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; dynamic_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(b).toString() &lt;&lt; endl;
            return;
        }
        catch (std::bad_cast)
        {}

        try
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; dynamic_cast&lt;SecondDerived &amp;&gt;(b).hello() &lt;&lt; endl;
            return;
        }
        catch (std::bad_cast)
        {}
    }
            
    int main()
    {
        Derived
            d;

        process(d);
        return (0);
    }
        
</pre>

    In this example the value <code>std::bad_cast</code> is introduced. The
<code>std::bad_cast</code> is thrown as an exception if the dynamic cast of a reference
to a base class object fails.
</p><p>The dynamic cast operator may be a handy tool when an existing base class
cannot or should not be modified (e.g., when the sources are not available),
and a derived class may be modified instead. Code receiving a base class
pointer or reference may then perform a dynamic cast to the derived class to
be able to use the derived class' functionality. 
</p><p>Casts from a base class reference or pointer to a derived class reference or
pointer are called <em>downcasts</em>.
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="l279"></a>
<h3>16.6.2: The typeid operator</h3>
        <a name="virtual/typeid"></a>
    As with the <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator, the <code>typeid</code> is usually applied to
base class objects, that are actually derived class objects. Similarly, the
base class should contain one or more virtual functions. 
</p><p>In order to use the <code>typeid</code> operator, the header file <code>typeinfo</code> must be
included: 
    <center><code>#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;</code> </center>
    Actually, the <code>typeid</code> operator returns an object of type <code>type_info</code>,
which may, e.g., be compared to other <code>type_info</code> objects. 
</p><p>The class <code>type_info</code> may be implemented differently by different
implementations, but at the very least it has the following interface:
        <pre>

    class type_info
    {
        public:
            virtual ~type_info();
            int operator==(const type_info &amp;other) const;
            int operator!=(const type_info &amp;other) const;
            char const *name() const;
        private:
            type_info(type_info const &amp;other);
            type_info &amp;operator=(type_info const &amp;other);
    };
        
</pre>

    Note that this class has a private copy constructor and overloaded
assignment operator. This prevents the normal construction or assignment of a
<code>type_info</code> object. <code>Type_info</code> objects are constructed and returned by
the <code>typeid</code> operator. Implementations, however, may choose to extend or
elaborate upon the <code>type_info</code> class and provide, e.g., lists of functions
that can be called in a certain class. 
</p><p>If the <code>type_id</code> operator is given a base class reference (where the
base class contains at least one virtual function), it will indicate that the
type of its operand is the derived class. For example:
        <pre>

    class Base;     // contains &gt;= 1 virtual functions
    class Derived: public Base;

    Derived
        d;
    Base
        &amp;br = d;

    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(br).name() &lt;&lt; endl;
        
</pre>

    In this example the <code>typeid</code> operator is given a base class reference.
It will print the text <code>Derived</code>, being the class name of the class <code>br</code>
actually refers to. If <code>Base</code> does not contain virtual functions, the text
<code>Base</code> would have been printed.
</p><p>The <code>typeid</code> operator can be used to determine the name of any type of
expression, not just of class type objects. For example:
        <pre>

    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(12).name() &lt;&lt; endl;     // prints:  int
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(12.23).name() &lt;&lt; endl;  // prints:  double
        
</pre>

    Note, however, that the above example is suggestive at most of the type
that is printed. It <em>may</em> be <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>, but this is not
necessarily the case. If portability is required, make sure no tests against
static, built-in strings are required. Check out what your compiler produces
in case of doubt.
</p><p>In situations where the <code>typeid</code> operator is applied to determine the
type of a derived class, it is important to realize that a base class
<em>reference</em> is used as the argument of the <code>typeid</code> operator. Consider the
following example:
        <pre>

    class Base;     // contains at least one virtual function
    class Derived: public Base;

    Base
        *bp = new Derived;      // base class pointer to derived object

    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Derived *))    // 1: false
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Base *))       // 2: true
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Derived))      // 3: false
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Base))         // 4: false
        ...
        
</pre>

    Here, <code>(1)</code> returns <code>false</code> as a <code>Base *</code> is not a <code>Derived
*</code>. <code>(2)</code> returns <code>true</code>, as the two pointer types are the same, <code>(3)</code>
and <code>(4)</code> return <code>false</code> as pointers to objects are not the objects
themselves. 
</p><p>On the other hand, if <code>*bp</code> is used in the above expressions, then
<code>(1)</code> and <code>(2)</code> return <code>false</code> as an object (or reference to an object)
is not a pointer to an object, whereas with
        <pre>

    if (typeid(*bp) == typeid(Derived))      // 3: true
        ...
    if (typeid(*bp) == typeid(Base))         // 4: false
        ...

    we see that <code>(3)</code> now returns <code>true</code>: <code>*bp</code> actually refers to a
<code>Derived</code> class object, and <code>typeid(*bp)</code> will return <code>typeid(Derived)</code>.
</p><p>A similar result is obtained if a base class reference is used:
</p><p><pre>

    Base
        &amp;br = *bp;
    
    if (typeid(br) == typeid(Derived))      // 3: true
        ...
    if (typeid(br) == typeid(Base))         // 4: false
        ...
        
</pre>

<h1>Is Jutta slightly megalomanic?</h1>

Jutta writes that she likes top billing. Well, here goes. Concerning the <a
href="/docs/cpp.html">C++ Annotations</a> guide she'd prefer the title page:

Jutta, looks as if this obliges you to keep the feedback about the C++ guide
coming! Or, in Jutta's own words:

<blockquote>

<i> Sometimes I wish everybody who's out on the web would have to take an oath
first, something like

<p>``I promise to not let the glitzy surface of my frontend blind me, to keep
in mind that humans write these things (who like feedback as much as a person
talking to me directly), and to complain and comment whenever something
strikes me as odd.  In other words, no, I won't be a passive consuming couch
potato like all the other guys.''

<p>The network manager then lifts his or her floppy with the latest Mosaic
release on it and asks: ``Promise?''

<p>To which the applicant replies ``Promise!  Honest!''

<p>The network manager then throws the applicant the floppy and mumbles
``Prove it!''

<p>at which point the party starts.
